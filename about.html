                        <p>A final year student at FAST as well as Programming Instructor and Curriculum Designer at IQuition, an American E-Learning company. Being on both, the giving and receiving ends of Programming education has allowed me to hone my analytical, reasoning, and communication skills. I care profoundly about the bleeding edge cloud technologies and am currently well on my way to get certified by Microsoft in their Azure Fundamentals. I have also earned some badges from Google Cloud using their Qwiklabs platform.

                            I carry a 3-Star Silver rank on Hackerrank's Python practice and strive to use AI and Machine Learning to solve real-world problems. I have worked on many NLP projects including an ASR System for (Speech to Text recognition) in Urdu and many more to come.
                            My Final Year Project involves Graph Database construction from unstructured text as well as querying it in Natural Language using a chatbot interface.

                            My adoration for the latest technologies and business of great organizations has allowed me to remain content with my profession as a computer scientist. I wish to make the most of my skills by delving deep into business intelligence and various areas of Data Science. 
                            
                            I am a confident, individual experienced in communicating with international clients, both in The States and abroad. I am adept at maintaining public and professional relationships, managing small teams, taking challenges head-on. I pride myself on the ability to adapt to new, growing, and fast-paced corporate environments and have a thirst to keep my growth perpetual. </p>
